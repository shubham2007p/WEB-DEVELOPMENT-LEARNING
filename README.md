# 🌐 WEB-DEVELOPMENT-LEARNING
A personal repo documenting my Web Development learning journey. Includes HTML, CSS, and JS practice, layout demos, and notes. Built as part of my goal to become job-ready in CS by 2025 and crack GSoC. Updated regularly as I grow and build in public. 🌱

This repository contains my learning journey through Web Development — starting from core HTML/CSS/JavaScript and gradually moving into full-stack development.

## 📚 What I'm Learning

- ✅ HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Basics to Intermediate)
- ✅ Layouts: Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design
- ✅ DOM Manipulation & Browser Events
- 🟡 Version Control with Git & GitHub
- 🟡 Backend with Python + Flask
- 🟡 REST APIs: Designing, Testing & Integrating
- 🔜 MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js (MERN Stack)
- 🔜 Authentication, Deployment & Real Projects

## 🎯 Why This Repo?

I’m a 1st-year CSE (AI/ML) student at GNIOT, working to become job-ready in CS by 2025 and crack GSoC along the way.

This repo helps me:
- Track my daily learning and coding practice
- Build projects step-by-step from front-end to back-end
- Organize code cleanly while learning Git workflows
- Learn in public and stay accountable

## 🚀 What's Coming Soon

- Mini Flask APIs for practice
- React basics + components
- Full MERN projects (Blog, Todo, Auth system)
- Final portfolio website

## 📌 Note

This is a learning-focused repo — you’ll find rough files, practice components, and evolving code quality.  
I'll keep refining as I grow and share all updates here.
